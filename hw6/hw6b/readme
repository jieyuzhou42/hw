add  all the product pages
Some interesting and useful JavaScript functionality: instead of creating a new cart page, I choose to use a popup modal for the cart. Because with the popup cart, 
customers can access their cart without going to another page, reminding them which item they are looking at. It will make the shopping process more convenient.
